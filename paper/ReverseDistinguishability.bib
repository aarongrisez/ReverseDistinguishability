	abstract = {We consider the problem of discriminating two different quantum states in the setting of asymptotically many copies, and determine the optimal strategy that minimizes the total probability of error. This leads to the identification of the quantum Chernoff bound, thereby solving a long standing open problem. The bound reduces to the classical Chernoff bound when the quantum states under consideration commute. The quantum Chernoff bound is the natural symmetric distance measure between quantum states because of its clear operational meaning and because of the fact that it does not seem to share the undesirable features of other distance measures like the fidelity, the trace norm and the relative entropy.},

	abstract = {A new algorithm is developed for computing arbitrary real powers Ap of a matrix A ∈ Cn×n. The algorithm starts with a Schur decomposition, takes k square roots of the triangular factor T, evaluates an [m=m] Padé approximant of ð1 − xÞp at I − T 1=2k , and squares the result k times. The parameters k and m are chosen to minimize the cost subject to achieving double precision accuracy in the evaluation of the Padé approximant, making use of a result that bounds the error in the matrix Padé approximant by the error in the scalar Padé approximant with argument the norm of the matrix. The Padé approximant is evaluated from the continued fraction representation in bottom-up fashion, which is shown to be numerically stable. In the squaring phase the diagonal and first superdiagonal are computed from explicit formulae for T p=2j , yielding increased accuracy. Since the basic algorithm is designed for p ∈ ð−1; 1Þ, a criterion for reducing an arbitrary real p to this range is developed, making use of bounds for the condition number of the Ap problem. How best to compute Ak for a negative integer k is also investigated. In numerical experiments the new algorithm is found to be superior in accuracy and stability to several alternatives, including the use of an eigendecomposition and approaches based on the formula Ap ¼ expðp logðAÞÞ.},

Density operators take the place of the probability density functions of conventional statistics. The optimum procedure for choosing between two hypotheses, and an approximate procedure valid at small signal-to-noise ratios and called threshold detection, are presented. Quantum estimation theory seeks best estimators of parameters of a density operator. A quantum counterpart of the Cramér-Rao inequality of conventional statistics sets a lower bound to the mean-square errors of such estimates. Applications at present are primarily to the detection and estimation of signals of optical frequencies in the presence of thermal radiation.},

	abstract = {We consider a compound testing problem within the Gaussian sequence model in which the null and alternative are specified by a pair of closed, convex cones. Such cone testing problem arise in various applications, including detection of treatment effects, trend detection in econometrics, signal detection in radar processing, and shape-constrained inference in non-parametric statistics. We provide a sharp characterization of the GLRT testing radius up to a universal multiplicative constant in terms of the geometric structure of the underlying convex cones. When applied to concrete examples, this result reveals some interesting phenomena that do not arise in the analogous problems of estimation under convex constraints. In particular, in contrast to estimation error, the testing error no longer depends purely on the problem complexity via a volume-based measure (such as metric entropy or Gaussian complexity), other geometric properties of the cones also play an important role. To address the issue of optimality, we prove information-theoretic lower bounds for minimax testing radius again in terms of geometric quantities. Our general theorems are illustrated by examples including the cases of monotone and orthant cones, and involve some results of independent interest.},

We prove a lower bound on the asymptotic rate exponents of Bayesian error probabilities. The bound represents a quantum extension of the Chernoff bound, which gives the best asymptotically achievable error exponent in classical discrimination between two probability measures on a finite set. In our framework, the classical result is reproduced if the two hypothetic density operators commute. Recently, it has been shown elsewhere [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 (2007) 160504] that the lower bound is achievable also in the generic quantum (noncommutative) case. This implies that our result is one part of the definitive quantum Chernoff bound.},

	abstract = {This thesis covers research in two disjoint research areas:

The ontological model program (formerly hidden-variables program) for quantum theory has a long and noble tradition in the quantum foundations literature.  By postulating a physical reality beyond the quantum state, we gain intuition on quantum phenomena and also come to understand constraints on realist interpretations of quantum theory.  Bell's theorem tells us that such an underlying reality must be non-local, while the Kochen-Specker contextuality theorem abuses the classical notion that measurement should simply reveal pre-existing properties of reality.  Recent research programs suggest that it is beneficial to view the quantum state as representing purely information.  We show that the only current model which does this in a satisfactory manner is unable to reproduce all the statistics of quantum measurements.  A recent generalization of the notion of contextuality has allowed for proofs of contextuality which differ from the original Kochen-Specker notion.  We add a new result which shows that measurements in a model where the quantum state represents information must be contextual.  Additionally, we refine the generalized notion of contextuality into strong and weak forms in order to parse the relationship between new and old results.  

Entanglement resource theory is a highly successful investigation of the usefulness of entanglement for information processing tasks.  In this thesis we apply the ideas from entanglement resource theory to another resource: state distinguishability.  We show analogies between distinguishability resource theory and entanglement resource theory.  In particular, the analogy includes: measures which are monotonic under a class of transformations; units of a resource; and bounds on measures in terms of the amount of the unit resource needed to form states and the amount of unit resource that can be extracted from states.  We show that the pairs of states which can be reversibly converted into {\textbackslash}emph\{classical states\} are exactly the pairs of simultaneously diagonalizable states.  Lastly, we characterize the trace-distance distinguishability of formation on a qubit system.},

That is, how to reverse trace distance? This problem originally arose in the study of statistical zero-knowledge quantum interactive proof. We discover a surprisingly simple way to do this job.
