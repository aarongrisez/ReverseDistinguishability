# Reverse Distinguishability
_This repo houses code used by Aaron Grisez during the summer of 2018 while conducting research at the Perimeter Institute for Physics in Waterloo ON_

## Modules
* test\_funm - This module tests the numerical stability of using scipy.funm to calculate the fractional powers of a matrix 

## To Do
* Need to find an effective way of evenly sampling over all quantum states of a given dimension.
